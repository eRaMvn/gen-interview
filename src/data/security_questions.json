Layer 1 would typically not mentioned because it represents the physical network connection. However, you can talk about ARP, how one machine knows the network gateway, dns server, and be prepare to go into the details at each layer. For example, for layer 2, make sure you know about ARP table, MAC address; for layer 6, know the HTTPS handshake, PKI infrastructure etc..."

The most important difference is symmetric key uses one key for both encryption and decryption while asymmetric encrypt requires a private key and public key. For encryption, we use public key to encrypt the data and use private key to decrypt it. We share our public to whoever needs to share the data with us. There are more to the use of asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is slower than symmetric encryption"

Basically, the idea is to have the scope for the work, what targets are allowed and what are not allowed. Assuming we have consent to do pentest, we would want to do reconnaissance to try to find the vulnerable targets (domains, ips) from the current landscape of the organization. There are a lot of useful techniques to identify and find interesting domains and ips as specified in the video. Once, we have the list of what we need to test, we can try OWASP Top 10 attacks, document the process on how we compromise the application, note the severity and how we can remediate the findings."

I would start from the bottom of the stack from layer 1 to layer 7. You can briefly talk about each layer in one for two sentences. Layer 1 would typically not mentioned because it represents the physical network connection. However, you can talk about ARP, how one machine knows the network gateway, dns server, and be prepare to go into the details at each layer. For example, for layer 2, make sure you know about ARP table, MAC address; for layer 6, know the HTTPS handshake, PKI infrastructure etc...",

        "comment": "We need to clearly distinguish the differences between the two. The most important difference is symmetric key uses one key for both encryption and decryption while asymmetric encrypt requires a private key and public key. For encryption, we use public key to encrypt the data and use private key to decrypt it. We share our public to whoever needs to share the data with us. There are more to the use of asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is slower than symmetric encryption",
